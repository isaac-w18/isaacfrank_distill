## Conclusion
The increased amount of money being spent on pharmaceuticals does not
seem to be helping the anxiety crisis, and something different must be
done to discover better ways of helping people overcome and adapt.
The Bergen 4 Day Treatment, for example, appears to be almost twofold 
more effective than standard ERP, but is not the standard itself yet
because of the lack of information, research, and data.



## About the Creator
My name is Isaac Frank, and I am a rising senior at Dublin Coffman High
School in Dublin, OH. I run cross country, play tennis, play cello, and
have been fascinated by science and health for longer than I can remember. 
My goal is to help others and improve health through research and data,
and I thoroughly enjoyed putting together this data project while 
learning the R programming language.

Thank you for reading!
